# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to the Nightfall Go SDK.

There are many ways to contribute, such as:
* Writing code samples
* Suggesting documentation improvements
* Submitting bug reports and feature requests
* Writing code to improve the library itself.

Please, don't use the issue tracker for personal support questions. Feel free to reach out to `support@nightfall.ai`
to address those issues.

## Responsibilities
* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux, etc.
* Ensure backwards compatibility with older Go versions
* Create issues for each major change and enhancement that you wish to make.
* Discuss proposed changes transparently and collect community feedback.
* Avoid introducing new external dependencies whenever possible. When absolutely required, validate the software
licenses used by these dependencies (e.g. avoid unintentional copyleft requirements).

## How to report a bug

### Security Disclosures 
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email `security@nightfall.ai` instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself the following questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?
* Is there a potential vulnerability stemming from a library dependency?

If you answered yes to any of the above questions, then you're probably dealing with a security issue.
Note that even if you answer "no" to all questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're
unsure, just email us at `security@nightfall.ai`.

### Creating an Issue
When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:
1. What version of Go are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. How did you discover the issue?
4. Is the issue reproducible? What are the steps to reproduce?
5. What did you expect to see?
6. What did you see instead?


## Suggesting a New Feature

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in this SDK, you are probably not alone.
There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which
describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

## Code Review

The core team looks at open pull requests on a regular basis. In order for your pull request to be merged, it
must meet the following requirements:
* It must pass the linter; make sure to run `gofmt -w *.go`.
* It must add unit tests to cover any new functionality.
* It must get approval from one of the code owners.

If a pull request remains idle for more than two weeks, we may close it.
